# 🚗 Simple Driving Game

A bare-bones Unity project demonstrating a working driving mechanic with a car, a few obstacles, and a functioning UI. This project is meant as a starting point to explore Unity’s input system, vehicle movement, and basic UI integration.

---

## 🎮 Features

* Drive a car with simple forward, backward, and turning controls.
* Obstacles placed in the scene for collisions and interaction.
* Basic UI showing game state (e.g., start/reset).
* Lightweight, minimal design – intended as a foundation for future driving-based projects.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Engine:** Unity (2021.3 LTS or newer recommended)
* **Language:** C#
* **Physics:** Unity Rigidbody & Colliders

---
