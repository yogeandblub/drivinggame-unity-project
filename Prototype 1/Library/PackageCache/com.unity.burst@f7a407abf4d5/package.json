    "changelog": "### Added\n- Linux/ARM64 support\n- Added Floating Point Mode option to Burst AOT Settings.\n- Added a warning that using processor intrinsics in methods with `FloatMode = Deterministic` requires bit-level equivalent functionality on other target architectures to ensure deterministic results.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed a crash that could occur in Burst when Unity is started with the `-disableManagedDebugger` command line argument\n- Fixed an issue where a static field of a large value type could cause an `InterpreterOutOfMemoryException` to be thrown.\n- Fixed Burst Inspector UI elements overlapping and losing interactability when the window size is reduced.\n\n### Changed\n- Optimized zero-initialization of local variables; where possible, zero-initialization is now done at first use rather than in the function prolog"
